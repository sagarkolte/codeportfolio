    "\n",
    "The CORD-19 Challenge is a list of 10 tasks that need to performed upon a fairly large corpus of scientific literature relating to the discipline of Virology and other related fields. The tasks listed in this challenge can be classified into two primary categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What do we know about...\n",
    "2. What has been published...\n",
    "\n",
    "While the two are, a priori, different questions, for the purposes of this challenge, we believe that we can treat them as interchangeable. We make this assumption because the authors of this notebook are not placed well so as to be able to tell the difference between what has been published and what is 'known' in the fields which this corpus concerns itself. Further, it is true to a fairly large degree that one cannot answer the first question without answering the second. Hence, for the rest of this notebook, we concern ourselves with the second question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any answer to a question about what has been published does not serve its purpose unless it also describes the relationships between the several pieces of literature. This is because a survey is seldom about data, and often about relationships. Thus in this notebook, we have attempted to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify articles of particular interest and merit about the various subtasks listed.\n",
    "2. Make a map of the relationships between these articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first task is achieved by stemming and tokenization, the second has been achieved by methods of agglomerative clustering and its [visualization](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.clustermap.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Process\n",
    "\n",
    "The following actions form the building blocks of this process:\n",
    "1. Choosing a vocabulary------------------------------------>(User Input)\n",
    "2. Generating Cluster Maps---------------------------------->(Using Lemmatization, Vectorization and Agglomerative Clustering)\n",
    "3. Inspecting Cluster Maps to identify promising articles--->(User Discretion)\n",
    "4. Inspecting Data Frames to read document contents--------->(User Discretion)\n",
    "\n",
    "The flow of the process is described in this diagram:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://github.com/sagarkolte/CORD-19/blob/master/KaggleSubmissionMaterial/Screenshot%202020-04-04%20at%209.04.56%20PM.png?raw=true)\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to search for information about the topics listed in the subtask, we paid special attention to the set of words that best described the subtask. Thus every search began with the choice of a vocabulary. We then associated to each document a vector by listing out the number of times each word in the vocabulary appeared in the absrtact of the article. We then used cluster maps to visualize what the set of all abstracts looked like as a set of vectors. This served two purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The cluster map gave us information about the availability of research on a certain topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. How much of this research was in the context of the other words in the vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we included the word 'virus' in the vocabulary, the clustermap showed that there was coupious amounts of research on the subject. However, very little of that was in the context of the Coronavirus, which is the focus of this challenge. Thus we have avoided including the word 'virus' in our vocabulary as it clouds the more subtle details in the clustermap.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have a view of the cluster map produced by the whole vocabulary, we restrict the vocabulary to fewer words and generate the cluster maps again. In this iteration, we see that the cluster maps aid us greatly in identifying promising articles rapidly.\n",
    "\n",
    "We illustrate this process with an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Task 1, Subtask 1: Range of incubation periods for the disease in humans (and how this varies across age and health status) and how long individuals are contagious, even after recovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Vocabulary:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. incubation\n",
    "2. age\n",
    "3. convalescent\n",
    "4. transmission\n",
    "5. contagious\n",
    "6. carrier\n",
    "7. convalescence\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "From the Main Cluster map, we conclude that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The relationship between age and transmission seems to be particularly well represented in the corpus.\n",
    "2. Incubation and transmission seem to have been discussed in a reasonable number of articles, it is however not as many as the first category.\n",
    "3. While 'convalescence' seems like a sparingly used word in the corpus, 'recovery' and 'transmission' appear together in a few documents, this gives us the hope that we might find information about convalescent transmitters in this overlap.\n",
    "4. We also seem fairly well placed in terms of finding information about 'transmission' during 'incubation'.\n",
    "5. The dependence of 'age' on 'incubation' periods also might be present here.\n",

    "\n",
    "We further restrict our vocabulary to the words: transmission, incubation, age.\n",
    "\n",
    "And identify the article with SHA 091a8e9a61e19e88caeb039f0e3888d111b20439.\n",
    "\n",
    "An actual investigation of the article will reveal that the content is very relevant to the subtask.\n",

    "## Summary of the search methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define a vocabulary\n",
    "2. Generate the main cluster diagram. (This .png file is saved in the output folder)\n",
    "3. Informed by the inspection of the main cluster diagram define a sub-vocabulary.\n",
    "4. Generate a cluster diagram using the sub-vocabulary. (This .png file is saved in the output folder)\n",
    "5. Generate an html file that contains the Title, Abstract and Author information of the most relevant papers. \n",
    "6. To parse the full text of a particular SHA, we use the function *get_sentences('sha','word_to_search')*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes about the algorithms used\n",
    "\n",
    "The principal philosophy at work here is that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Given a set of words, we can associate to every document a vector of the count of words. **([Lemmatization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmatisation), [tokenization](https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/tokenization-1.html))\n",
    "2. We then treat all documents as vectors and perform agglomerative clustering the set of vectors. **([Agglomerative Clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_clustering#Agglomerative_clustering_example))\n",
    "3. We represent the results of our clustering using cluster maps. **([Seaborn Cluster Maps](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.clustermap.html))\n",
    "4. We use sentence tokenization to search for sentences that contain the words of our interest. **([sent_tokenize](https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.tokenize.html))\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Drawbacks of the proposed approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The algorigithm currently is only vectorizing article abstracts. While getting it to parse the whole text is not a difficult code change, it consumes a significant amount of comuting power and time. We did not have this luxury given the deadlines. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Possible Resolution: We call upon the experts in parallel processing and threading to help us out with this issue.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. We have not managed to make our cluster maps interactive, for instance, if we find a particular row of the map interesting, we should be able to hover over the row to be able to see the abstract and title of the associated article.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Possible Resolution: We call upon the members well versed with interactive visualization libraries in Python to collaborate with us on this topic.\n",

    "text: \"We investigate the effects of delaying the time to recovery (delayed recovery) and of nonuniform transmission on the propagation of diseases on structured populations. Through a mean-field approximation and large-scale numerical simulations, we find that postponing the transition from the infectious to the recovered states can largely reduce the epidemic threshold, therefore promoting the outbreak of epidemics. On the other hand, if we consider nonuniform transmission among individuals, the epidemic threshold increases, thus inhibiting the spreading process. When both mechanisms are at work, the latter might prevail, hence resulting in an increase of the epidemic threshold with respect to the standard case, in which both ingredients are absent. Our findings are of interest for a better understanding of how diseases propagate on structured populations and to a further design of efficient immunization strategies.\"\n",

    "\"text\": \"The role of and the extent to which infected asymptomatic human cases play a role in transmission is unknown. WHO estimates that ~20% of reported MERS cases are asymptomatic (54), but this estimate is likely underestimated given surveillance focuses on severe cases requiring hospitalization (55) and evidence from serologic studies (32) . One study documented prolonged shedding of MERS-CoV in an asymptomatic health care worker (56) , which provides evidence that, if not properly isolated, asymptomatic cases in health care settings and in the community could lead to onward transmission. The experts included in this study believe that contact with asymptomatic cases is as important as that with infected dromedaries. Comprehensive testing of contacts of MERS-CoV patients, regardless of the presence of symptoms, is required to evaluate infection between known cases. The role of asymptomatic cases or carriers, if they are indeed infected, also needs careful consideration in the community setting. Not all reported primary cases can be traced back to contact with dromedaries, and it is likely, at least in some cases, that an asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic case may be an intermediary between dromedary contact and a symptomatic human case.\",\n",

    "    Excerpt:\n",
    "\"text\": \"A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) first detected in Wuhan, China, has spread rapidly since December 2019, causing more than 80,000 confirmed infections and 2,700 fatalities (as of Feb 27, 2020). Imported cases and transmission clusters of various sizes have been reported globally suggesting a pandemic is likely. Here, we explore how seasonal variation in transmissibility could modulate a SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Data from routine diagnostics show a strong and consistent seasonal variation of the four endemic coronaviruses (229E, HKU1, NL63, OC43) and we parameterize our model for SARS-CoV-2 using these data. The model allows for many subpopulations of different size with variable parameters. Simulations of different scenarios show that plausible parameters result in a small peak in early 2020 in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and a larger peak in winter 2020/2021. Variation in transmission and migration rates can result in substantial variation in prevalence between regions. While the uncertainty in parameters is large, the scenarios we explore show that transient reductions in the incidence rate might be due to a combination of seasonal variation and infection control efforts but do not necessarily mean the epidemic is contained. Seasonal forcing on SARS-CoV-2 should thus be taken into account in the further monitoring of the global transmission. The likely aggregated effect of seasonal variation, infection control measures, and transmission rate variation is a prolonged pandemic wave with lower prevalence at any given time, thereby providing a window of opportunity for better preparation of health care systems.\",\n",

    "\"text\": \"Influenza viruses display distinct seasonal patterns in temperate climates with peak infection rates occurring in the winter months and little to no influenza virus activity detected at other times of the year [1] . However, it is not completely understood why we have \\\"flu seasons\\\". The same seasonal trends do not necessarily apply to regions in tropic and subtropic climates where influenza virus activity can be detected year round. Social and health factors such as indoor crowding and seasonal fluctuations in host immunity have been offered as explanations for influenza seasonality, but the lack of direct evidence supporting these theories suggests that the environment may be the most relevant contributor and potential driving force of seasonality [1, 2] . Although seasonal influenza viruses display predictable infection patterns, the four most recent influenza virus pandemics began with newly emerged viruses appearing outside the usual influenza season (1918 Spanish Influenza A H1N1, 1957 -1958 Asian Influenza A H2N2, 1968 Hong Kong Influenza A H3N2, 2009 H1N1) [3, 4] . Emergence of the most recent pandemic virus was preceded by reports of sporadic infections of a swine-origin H1N1 virus in young individuals [4, 5] . During the summers of 2010-2014, reports have emerged in the Midwest region of the U.S. of H3N2 variant influenza virus infections in children with a recent history of exposure to swine [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . These events highlight the importance of closely monitoring emerging strains of influenza viruses throughout the year and the need for our improved understanding of the effects of environmental conditions like temperature and humidity on influenza virus transmission.\",\n",

    "\n",
    "    Excerpt:\n",
    "\"text\": \"Prior studies of clay-virus interactions have focused on the stability and infectivity of nonenveloped viruses, yielding contradictory results. We hypothesize that the surface charge distribution of the clay and virus envelope dictates how the components react and affect aggregation, viral stability, and infectivity. The bacteriophage Cystoviridae species \\u03c66 used in this study is a good model for enveloped pathogens. The interaction between \\u03c66 and montmorillonite (MMT) clay (the primary component of bentonite) is explored by transmission electron microscopy. The analyses show that MMT-\\u03c66 mixtures undergo heteroaggregation, forming structures in which virtually all the virions are either sequestered between MMT platelet layers or attached to platelet edges. The virions swell and undergo disassembly resulting in partial or total envelope loss. Edgeattached viral envelopes distort to increase contact area with the positively charged platelet edges indicating that the virion surface is negatively charged. The nucleocapsid (NCs) remaining after envelope removal also exhibit distortion, in contrast to detergent-produced NCs which exhibit no distortion. This visually discernible disassembly is a mechanism for loss of infectivity previously unreported by studies of nonenveloped viruses. The MMT-mediated sequestration and disassembly result in reduced infectivity, suggesting that clays may reduce infectivity of enveloped pathogenic viruses in soils and sediments.\",\n",

    "\"text\": \"The LSTO Ti-V-O coating also demonstrated excellent antibacterial properties ( Figure 11 ). Similar to HTA Ti-V-O coatings, the titanium oxide produced through LSTO had photoactive antibacterial effects [17, 18] , and the vanadium oxide produced also exhibited antibacterial properties [19] . By combining titanium oxide and vanadium oxide, the presented results coincided with the study of Wren et al., indicating that the Ti-V-O thin film exhibited greater antibacterial properties [20] . By contrast, the 100 kHz of LSTO Ti-V-O coating demonstrated higher antibacterial properties because of its superhydrophobic surface (i.e., exhibiting a water contact angle of 140 \\u2022 ). In reference to Zhang et al. [11] , when the coating surface came into contact with bacteria cells, the superhydrophobic surface lowered the binding power between the bacteria cell and sample surface. This reduced bacterial cells' ability to attach to the sample surface, resulting in antibacterial effects. As a result of this, the 100 kHz LSTO Ti-V-O coating seems to exhibit superior antibacterial properties compared with the 300 kHz and 500 kHz LSTO Ti-V-O coatings. The present study verified that the Ti-V-O coating exhibited excellent antibacterial properties, and the vanadium compounds within the Ti-V-O coating induced inflammation in cells. Some researchers have indicated that oxidation states of vanadium could induce DNA damage [21, 22] in cells, and excessive amounts of vanadium compounds exert observable toxic effects on body tissues [23] . Although vanadium has been confirmed as a toxic transition metal, the application of it, in cancer treatment and as a novel medicine in special compounds against viral infections, such as Dengue fever, SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), and HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) [24] , still shows great potential for the future. \",\n",

Antiserum raised in rabbits against a 31 amino acid synthetic polypeptide that represented the central hydrophilic region of HP specifically immunoprecipitated HP from TGEV-infected cells. HP was further shown to become associated with microsomal membranes during synthesis in vitro and was found to be closely associated with the endoplasmic reticulum and cell surface membranes in infected cells.

Human-to-human transmissions have been described with incubation times between 2-10 days, facilitating its spread via droplets, contaminated hands or surfaces. We therefore reviewed the literature on all available information about the persistence of human and veterinary coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces as well as inactivation strategies with biocidal agents used for chemical disinfection, e.g. in healthcare facilities. The analysis of 22 studies reveals that human coronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus or endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV) can persist on inanimate surfaces like metal, glass or plastic for up to 9 days, but can be efficiently inactivated by surface disinfection procedures with 62e71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite within 1 minute. Other biocidal agents such as 0.05e0.2% benzalkonium chloride or 0.02% chlorhexidine digluconate are less effective. As no specific therapies are available for SARS-CoV-2, early containment and prevention of further spread will be crucial to stop the ongoing outbreak and to control this novel infectious thread.',\n",

FCV was isolated from the oral fauces of 11% of healthy cats upon entry, and isolation rates were highest for kittens (33%). FHV shedding was very low (4%) at the time of entry and occurred mainly in juveniles. FECV shedding was also common among newly relinquished cats (33%), especially older kittens and juveniles (90%). The subsequent spread of all three viruses was rapid and efficient in the shelter environment. Fifteen percent of cats were shedding FCV, 52% FHV, and 60% FECV after 1 week. More detailed studies were done with FECV shedding, which could be accurately quantitated. The amounts of FECV shed by infected cats ranged from 10 2 to 10 16 particles/swab of feces. FECV shedding was several logs higher in young kittens with primary infection than adult cats with primary infections. The mean levels of FECV shedding among adults were the same for primary and chronic infections. Although shelters were not the primary source of these viruses for many relinquished cats, factors intrinsic to the shelter environment were critical in amplifying shedding and spread to susceptible individuals. Extrinsic factors were especially important for the spread of FHV and FECV. FHV shedding rates increased from 4% to 50% in 1 week's time. The speed and magnitude of the increase in FHV shedding suggested that there was reactivation of latent infections as well as acquisition of new infections. FECV shedding increased 10 to 1,000,000 fold in 1 week among cats that were already infected at entry, and more than one-half of initially negative cats were shedding FECV a week later. Feline calicivirus infection was the least likely to spread in the shelter. The infection rate only increased from 11 to 15% in 1 week.\",\n",

    "text: \"The main route of transmission of SARS CoV infection is presumed to be respiratory droplets. However the virus is also detectable in other body fluids and excreta. The stability of the virus at different temperatures and relative humidity on smooth surfaces were studied. The dried virus on smooth surfaces retained its viability for over 5 days at temperatures of 22-25 • C and relative humidity of 40-50%, that is, typical air-conditioned environments. However, virus viability was rapidly lost (>3 log 10 ) at higher temperatures and higher relative humidity (e.g., 38 • C, and relative humidity of >95%). The better stability of SARS coronavirus at low temperature and low humidity environment may facilitate its transmission in community in subtropical area (such as Hong Kong) during the spring and in air-conditioned environments. It may also explain why some Asian countries in tropical area (such as Malaysia, Indonesia or Thailand) with high temperature and high relative humidity environment did not have major community outbreaks of SARS.\"\n",

    "text: \"Background: Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are common during the Hajj season and are caused by a variety of organisms, which can be transmitted via the air or contaminated surfaces. We conducted a study aimed at sampling the environment in the King Abdul Aziz International (KAAI) Airport, Pilgrims City, Jeddah, during Hajj season to detect respiratory pathogens. Methods: Active air sampling was conducted using air biosamplers, and swabs were used to sample frequently touched surfaces. A respiratory multiplex array was used to detect bacterial and viral respiratory pathogens. Results: Of the 58 environmental samples, 8 were positive for at least 1 pathogen. One air sample (1 of 18 samples, 5.5%) tested positive for influenza B virus. Of the 40 surface samples, 7 (17.5%) were positive for pathogens. These were human adenovirus (3 out of 7, 42.8%), human coronavirus OC43/HKU1 (3 out of 7, 42.8%), Haemophilus influenzae (1 out of 7, 14.2%), and Moraxella catarrhalis (1 out of 7, 14.2%). Chair handles were the most commonly contaminated surfaces. The handles of 1 chair were cocontaminated with coronavirus OC43/HKU1 and H influenzae. Conclusion: Respiratory pathogens were detected in the air and on surfaces in the KAAI Airport in Pilgrims City. Larger-scale studies based on our study are warranted to determine the role of the environment in transmission of respiratory pathogens during mass gathering events (eg, Hajj) such that public health preventative measures might be better targeted.\"\n",
