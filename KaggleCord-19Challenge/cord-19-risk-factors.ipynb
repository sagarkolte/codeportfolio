    "\n",
    "> We have power over the things we give a name.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CORD-19 Challenge is a list of 10 tasks that need to performed upon a fairly large corpus of scientific literature relating to the discipline of Virology and other related fields. The tasks listed in this challenge can be classified into two primary categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What do we know about...\n",
    "2. What has been published...\n",
    "\n",
    "While the two are, a priori, different questions, for the purposes of this challenge, we believe that we can treat them as interchangeable. We make this assumption because the authors of this notebook are not placed well so as to be able to tell the difference between what has been published and what is 'known' in the fields which this corpus concerns itself. Further, it is true to a fairly large degree that one cannot answer the first question without answering the second. Hence, for the rest of this notebook, we concern ourselves with the second question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any answer to a question about what has been published does not serve its purpose unless it also describes the relationships between the several pieces of literature. This is because a survey is seldom about data, and often about relationships. Thus in this notebook, we have attempted to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify articles of particular interest and merit about the various subtasks listed.\n",
    "2. Make a map of the relationships between these articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first task is achieved by stemming and tokenization, the second has been achieved by methods of agglomerative clustering and its [visualization](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.clustermap.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Process\n",
    "\n",
    "The following actions form the building blocks of this process:\n",
    "1. Choosing a vocabulary------------------------------------>(User Input)\n",
    "2. Generating Cluster Maps---------------------------------->(Using Lemmatization, Vectorization and Agglomerative Clustering)\n",
    "3. Inspecting Cluster Maps to identify promising articles--->(User Discretion)\n",
    "4. Inspecting Data Frames to read document contents--------->(User Discretion)\n",
    "\n",
    "The flow of the process is described in this diagram:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://github.com/sagarkolte/CORD-19/blob/master/KaggleSubmissionMaterial/Screenshot%202020-04-04%20at%209.04.56%20PM.png?raw=true)\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to search for information about the topics listed in the subtask, we paid special attention to the set of words that best described the subtask. Thus every search began with the choice of a vocabulary. We then associated to each document a vector by listing out the number of times each word in the vocabulary appeared in the absrtact of the article. We then used cluster maps to visualize what the set of all abstracts looked like as a set of vectors. This served two purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The cluster map gave us information about the availability of research on a certain topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. How much of this research was in the context of the other words in the vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we included the word 'virus' in the vocabulary, the clustermap showed that there was coupious amounts of research on the subject. However, very little of that was in the context of the Coronavirus, which is the focus of this challenge. Thus we have avoided including the word 'virus' in our vocabulary as it clouds the more subtle details in the clustermap.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have a view of the cluster map produced by the whole vocabulary, we restrict the vocabulary to fewer words and generate the cluster maps again. In this iteration, we see that the cluster maps aid us greatly in identifying promising articles rapidly.\n",
    "\n",
    "We illustrate this process with an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Task 1, Subtask 1: Range of incubation periods for the disease in humans (and how this varies across age and health status) and how long individuals are contagious, even after recovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Vocabulary:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. incubation\n",
    "2. age\n",
    "3. convalescent\n",
    "4. transmission\n",
    "5. contagious\n",
    "6. carrier\n",
    "7. convalescence\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "From the Main Cluster map, we conclude that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The relationship between age and transmission seems to be particularly well represented in the corpus.\n",
    "2. Incubation and transmission seem to have been discussed in a reasonable number of articles, it is however not as many as the first category.\n",
    "3. While 'convalescence' seems like a sparingly used word in the corpus, 'recovery' and 'transmission' appear together in a few documents, this gives us the hope that we might find information about convalescent transmitters in this overlap.\n",
    "4. We also seem fairly well placed in terms of finding information about 'transmission' during 'incubation'.\n",
    "5. The dependence of 'age' on 'incubation' periods also might be present here.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "We further restrict our vocabulary to the words: transmission, incubation, age.\n",
    "\n",
    "And identify the article with SHA 091a8e9a61e19e88caeb039f0e3888d111b20439.\n",
    "\n",
    "An actual investigation of the article will reveal that the content is very relevant to the subtask.\n",

    "## Summary of the search methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define a vocabulary\n",
    "2. Generate the main cluster diagram. (This .png file is saved in the output folder)\n",
    "3. Informed by the inspection of the main cluster diagram define a sub-vocabulary.\n",
    "4. Generate a cluster diagram using the sub-vocabulary. (This .png file is saved in the output folder)\n",
    "5. Generate an html file that contains the Title, Abstract and Author information of the most relevant papers. \n",
    "6. To parse the full text of a particular SHA, we use the function *get_sentences('sha','word_to_search')*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes about the algorithms used\n",
    "\n",
    "The principal philosophy at work here is that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Given a set of words, we can associate to every document a vector of the count of words. **([Lemmatization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmatisation), [tokenization](https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/tokenization-1.html))\n",
    "2. We then treat all documents as vectors and perform agglomerative clustering the set of vectors. **([Agglomerative Clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_clustering#Agglomerative_clustering_example))\n",
    "3. We represent the results of our clustering using cluster maps. **([Seaborn Cluster Maps](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.clustermap.html))\n",
    "4. We use sentence tokenization to search for sentences that contain the words of our interest. **([sent_tokenize](https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.tokenize.html))\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Drawbacks of the proposed approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The algorigithm currently is only vectorizing article abstracts. While getting it to parse the whole text is not a difficult code change, it consumes a significant amount of comuting power and time. We did not have this luxury given the deadlines. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Possible Resolution: We call upon the experts in parallel processing and threading to help us out with this issue.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. We have not managed to make our cluster maps interactive, for instance, if we find a particular row of the map interesting, we should be able to hover over the row to be able to see the abstract and title of the associated article.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Possible Resolution: We call upon the members well versed with interactive visualization libraries in Python to collaborate with us on this topic.\n",

    "## Observations on the Main Cluster Diagram\n",
    "### Smoking as a risk factor, some general remarks.\n",
    "As can be seen from the main cluster diagram, the articles that discuss smoking as a risk factor for COVID patients is rather sparse. Infact we found only two relevant articles on the subject. We will mention the findings in these articles in the subsection below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preexisting Pulmonary Conditions as a risk factor\n",
    "Here too the literature is surprisingly sparse, infact we found only one article in the corpus which discusses preexisting pulmonary conditons in the context of COVID. There is however, another article that discusses this risk factor in the context of SARS, which is a condition caused by the same family of viruses. We have mentioned these articles in the notes below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coninfections as a factor that enhance transmissibility\n",
    "There is no evidence of the presence of literature that studies the relationship between transmissibility of COVID-19 and coinfections or comorbidities. However this article discusses the phenomena for other diseases:\n",
    "1026a224b61ae21079fcc5680b0cc6afef335523\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comorbidity as a risk factor in COVID-19 patients\n",
    "There seems to be conclusive literature on the effect of certain comorbidites on the severity of COVID-19 infections and fatalities. This will be discussed in some detail below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pregnancy and COVID\n",
    "This section is not an exception to the sparseness of literature, however it is better off than the previous sections. And the articles seem to be rather conclusive as will be summarized below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Risk faced by children in the context of COVID\n",
    "There is conclusive, but not necessarily ample, research on the nature of COVID-19 among chidren.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Social structure and other social factors\n",
    "One hurdle we face while investigating this issue is the presence of the ubiquitous bigram 'social distancing' which is not always related to the topic at hand. However, the search has returned some relevant articles which will be presented below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Behavioral Factors\n",
    "While there are articles discussing the importance of behavioral changes as a mitigation measure for the pandemic, we found no articles which study the behavioral differences in societies and their impact on the transmission of the virus.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Economic Factors\n",
    "While most articles returned by the algorithm are about the economic impact of the pandemic on countries and cities, there is one article which discusses the role of economic factors in the spread of the pandemic. We believe that a different choice of the vocabulary will give us more relevant results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Smoking and Preexisting Pulmonary Diseases\n",
    "### Smoking\n",
    "There seems to be evidence that current smokers (as opposed to eternal or heavy smokers) and people with chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases have a higher expression of **angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2)** which is used by the COVID-19 virus as a cellular entry receptor to infect the lower respiratory tract. Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "        Leung et al.(https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00688-2020) observe that \"Because individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are at increased risk of severe COVID-19, we determined whether ACE-2 expression in the lower airways was related to COPD and cigarette smoking.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "        \n",
    "        Finally they conclude saying: *Current smoking also significantly increased ACE2 expression levels compared with never smokers (never current smokers=2.77 (90.91) CPM versus smokers=1.78 (0.39) CPM, p=0.024). These findings were replicated in the two external cohorts. Conclusions: ACE2 expression in lower airways is increased in patients with COPD and with current smoking. These data suggest that these two subgroups are at increased risk of serious COVID19 infection and highlight the importance of smoking cessation in reducing the risk.*\n",

    "\n",
    "        Bass et al.(https://doi.org/10.1089/jir.2006.26.309) observe that \"Global expression patterns showed limited correlation between end-stage ARDS and the initiating pathogen, but when focusing on a subset of genes implicated in pulmonary pathogenesis, molecular signatures of pulmonary disease were obtained and appeared to be influenced by preexisting pulmonary complications and also bacterial components of infection.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "## Coinfections and Comorbidities as risk factors\n",
    "As to the question whether the presence of coinfections and comorbidities make the virus more transmissible, we found no literature addressing this question for the COVID-19 virus specifically. We do however have an article by Merler et al.(https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2008.06.004) which speaks of the relationship of transmissibility with coinfections for other diseases. We give an excerpt:\n",
    "\n",
    "        the pandemic outbreaks may also be influenced by coinfection with other acute respiratory infections (ari) that increase transmissibility of influenza virus (by coughing, sneezing, running nose). in fact, some viruses (e.g., rhinovirus and adenovirus) have been found to induce clouds of bacteria and increase the transmissibility of staphylococcus aureus.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        \n",
    "        in this paper, by assuming increased transmissibility in coinfected individuals, we propose and study a model where multiple pandemic waves are triggered by coinfection with ari. the model agrees well with mortality excess data during the 1918 pandemic influenza, thereby providing indications for potential pandemic mitigation.\n",
    "        \n",
    "There is however important literature comparing COVID-19 patients with and without coinfections. In a study of two groups of patients from the province of Wuhan and from the Qingdao region. The patients from the latter were predominantly coinfected and the former had a majority of non-coinfected patients. \n",
    "\n",
    "        Xing et al.(https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.29.20027698) observe that: *it can be seen that covid-19 patients had distinct aetiological features of coinfection from cap patients., latex none, type figure, figref3 text \"who were elder with more underlying diseases), there are no signs of worsening of these patients(from the Qingdao province) clinical manifestations or disease prognosis as compared with wuhan patients*\n",
    "        \n",
    "        They also note that: *we were unable to exclude the possibility that coinfection with other respiratory pathogens may make the patients more susceptible to sars-cov-2 infection.*\n",
    "  \n",
    "There is also literature which indicates that the in-vivo interactions between viruses of the Corona family is 'positive' that is, the viruses help each other rather than fight each other in the body.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        Nickbakhsh et al.(https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.18.20037101) report that *in previous extensive analyses of virus-virus interactions, we found a strong signal of positive interactions at the within-host scale between human coronaviruses overall and respiratory syncytial virus (rsv), adenovirus (adv) and parainfluenza viruses* \n",

    "Finally, Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a comorbidity which has been studied by Xu et al(https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042408). They make rather conclusive remarks in their work:\n",
    "\n",
    "        In conclusion, male elderly COVID-19 patients with diabetes are more susceptible to AKI. AKI at early stage may be a negative prognostic indicator for COVID-19.\n",
    "        \n",

Although AKI was more common in critical ill patients with COVID-19, there was no significant association between oxygenation index and renal functional indices among COVID-19 patients with AKI. By multivariate logistic regression, male, older age and comorbidity with diabetes were three important independent risk factors predicting AKI among COVID-19 patients. Among 56 COVID-19 patients with AKI, 33.9% were died on mean 10.9 day after hospitalization.\n",
    "        \n",

    "## Socio-economic and behavioral factors to understand the economic impact of the virus and whether there were differences.\n",
    "If one is to allow that the demography of a population is related to its social and economic structure then the work of Dowd et al.(https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.15.20036293) makes the following remarks:\n",
    "\n",
    "        Because deaths have been concentrated at older ages, we highlight the important role of demography, particularly how the age structure of a population may help explain differences in fatality rates across countries and how transmission unfolds. We examine the role of age structure in deaths thus far in Italy and South Korea and illustrate how the pandemic could unfold in populations with similar population sizes but different age structures, showing a dramatically higher burden of mortality in countries with older versus younger populations. This powerful interaction of demography and current age-specific mortality for COVID-19 suggests that social distancing and other policies to slow transmission should consider both the age composition of local and national contexts as well as the social connectedness of older and younger generations.\n",
    "        \n",
    "         Population ageing is currently more pronounced in wealthier countries, which mercifully may lessen the impact of this pandemic on poorer countries with weaker health systems but younger age structures. It is plausible that poor general health status and co- infections such as tuberculosis may still increase the danger of COVID-19 among younger cases in these countries. Thus far, the lower than expected number of cases detected in Africa (despite extensive trade and travel links with China), suggests that the young age structure of the continent may be protective of severe and thus detectable cases, or it may be undetected. Beyond age structure, there are large sex differences in mortality that need to be understood – with men at higher risk – some of which may be accounted for by the stark differences in smoking rates by sex in Asia. Distributions of underlying co- morbidities such as diabetes, hypertension and COPD will likewise refine risk estimates. \n",
